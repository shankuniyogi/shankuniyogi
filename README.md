<h2>Free-Range Dev.</h2>
<p>Software development has created a lifetime of opportunities for me, and I’ve spent most of my career building tools that help millions of developers do the same. Over more than 25 years, I’ve worked and led teams at places like Microsoft, Google, and GitHub - and helped create and grow products such as Visual Studio Code, GitHub, ASP.NET, and Typescript.</p>
<p>These days, I am exploring new ways to help more people learn to become developers, and advising startups and entrepreneurs who aspire to build world-class developer products.</p>
